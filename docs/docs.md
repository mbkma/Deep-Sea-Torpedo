Core Concept

You control a submarine in the depths of the ocean, navigating through trenches, wrecks, and caves while avoiding or engaging enemy submarines and sharks. The game emphasizes stealth, strategic movement, and resource management.
Gameplay Features
1. Movement & Physics

    The submarine moves with realistic physics, including inertia and water resistance.

    Vertical movement via ballast controls for diving and surfacing.

    Thrusters for slow and precise movement.

    Silent mode reduces noise but slows movement.

2. Stealth Mechanics

    Noise-based detection: Enemies detect you based on engine noise and sonar pings.

    Sonar system: Active sonar reveals the surroundings but exposes your position, while passive sonar lets you listen for enemies.

    Hiding spots: Stay undetected by hiding in underwater caves or behind terrain.

3. Enemies

    Enemy Submarines: Equipped with sonar, torpedoes, and depth charges. Can actively hunt you.

    Sharks: Attracted to noise and blood. If injured, they may swarm the area.

    Mines & Drones: Mines float in certain areas, and AI drones patrol high-security zones.

4. Weapons & Tools

    Torpedoes: Homing and dumb-fire options.

    Decoys: Noise-making devices to mislead enemies.

    EMP Blast: Temporarily disables enemy sonar and electronics.

    Repair Drone: Fixes damage but makes noise.

5. Exploration & Progression

    Missions involve infiltration, sabotage, and deep-sea treasure hunting.

    Upgrades for sonar, weapons, hull armor, and stealth systems.

    Dark ocean environments with bioluminescent life, ruins, and wrecks.

Godot 4.4 Technical Implementation

    3D Physics: RigidBody3D or CharacterBody3D for the submarine with water resistance.

    AI: Navigation using NavigationAgent3D, noise-based enemy AI.

    Rendering: Volumetric lighting, fog, and particle effects for deep-sea immersion.

    Audio: Dynamic underwater soundscapes, muffled effects, and directional audio.
